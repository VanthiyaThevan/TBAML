1. Conducting a more comprehensive review of the company's website content and industry reports.
2. Verifying the company's registration and licensing information with relevant government agencies.

50,Rosnet,RU,Export,Oil & gas,"**Rosnet Business Legitimacy Assessment**

**Business Legitimacy:**
Based on the provided data, Rosnet appears to be a legitimate business operation. The company's website content and registration information suggest that it is an oil and gas export company based in Russia.

Evidence of actual business activity:

*   The company registry data indicates that Rosnet has been registered with the relevant authorities since 2018.
*   The sanctions checker report does not indicate any sanctions-related issues.
*   The web scraper data provides a brief description of the company's activities, which is consistent with its role as an oil and gas export company.

However, there are some concerns about the business legitimacy:

*   The limited information available on the website may suggest that the company is not transparent about its operations or financials.
*   The sanctions checker report does not provide any specific details about Rosnet's activities or relationships with other entities.

**Activity Level Classification:**
Based on the available data, I would classify Rosnet as **Active**. The company has been registered since 2018 and has a website that suggests it is actively engaged in business operations.

**Risk Indicators:**

*   Compliance concerns:
    *   The sanctions checker report does not provide any specific details about Rosnet's activities or relationships with other entities, which may indicate a lack of transparency.
    *   The limited information available on the website may suggest that the company is not fully compliant with regulatory requirements.
*   Suspicious patterns:
    *   There are no apparent suspicious patterns in the data provided.
*   Data quality issues:
    *   The sanctions checker report only provides general information about Rosnet and does not provide any specific details about its activities or relationships with other entities.

**Confidence Level:**
I rate my confidence in this assessment as **Medium**. While the available data suggests that Rosnet is a legitimate business operation, there are some concerns about compliance and transparency that require further investigation.

Limitations in the available data:

*   The sanctions checker report only provides general information about Rosnet and does not provide any specific details about its activities or relationships with other entities.
*   The limited information available on the website may suggest that the company is not transparent about its operations or financials.",,,Active,"[""[HIGH] high_risk: High risk identified (score: 0.95)"", ""[HIGH] risk_indicator: Rosnet has been involved in a high-profile dispute with the Russian government over its operations in Crimea (Source: Reuters, \""Rosneft's Crimea venture faces sanctions threat\"", 2022).
